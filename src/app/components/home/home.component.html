          <h5>Okay, so my pick for 2020 is Assassin's Creed Valhalla, out of my top three, Valhalla had the least glitches. I loved the return of the Hidden Blade and callbacks to Assassin's Creed III. The story was also more engaging than the previous entry in the series, as each member of the Order of the Ancients go their own death monologue, similar to previous titles. Hunting down the Order also feels less like a wild goose chase and more a serious hunt. I also enjoyed the continued expansion of the lore, with many more Norse/Gaelic deities revealed to be Isu. The combat also improved, feeling much more like Origins with some added brutality. Blocking and counterattacking is also much easier too. There are some issues timeline-wise, it's difficult to track when certain quests are occuring but with historical fact checking I worked out a rough basis. With this title being the newest in a long line of titles, it's obviously not recommended as an introduction to the series. At the very least - play Origins and Odyssey first. </h5>
